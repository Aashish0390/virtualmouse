Virtual Mouse - Tracking using Hand Gesture Recognition.

This is a Python project that uses machine learning and computer vision to recognize hand gestures and use them to control the mouse cursor on a computer. The project uses the following libraries:-

MediaPipe:- a library for building machine learning pipelines to process multimedia data, including video streams.

OpenCV(cv2):- OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library.

NumPy:- a library for numerical computing in Python.

Win32api:- a module for providing access to the Windows API.

PyAutoGUI:- a module for controlling the mouse and keyboard.

SETUP:-

Before running the project, ensure you have installed all the libraries mentioned above.

Running the PROJECT:-

Run the script and the webcam will be turned on, tracking your hand movement to move the cursor and clicking using your fingers.

Move your index finger to move the cursor on the screen and pinch your index finger and thumb together to perform a click. The distance between the index finger tip and the thumb tip will be calculated to perform a click.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:- 

This project is based on the MediaPipe and OpenCVÂ libraries.
